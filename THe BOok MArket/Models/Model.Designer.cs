//// To enable legacy code generation, change the value of the 'Code Generation Strategy' designer
//// property to 'Legacy ObjectContext'. This property is available in the Properties Window when the model
//// is open in the designer.

//// If no context and entity classes have been generated, it may be because you created an empty model but
//// have not yet chosen which version of Entity Framework to use. To generate a context class and entity
//// classes for your model, open the model in the designer, right-click on the designer surface, and
//// select 'Update Model from Database...', 'Generate Database from Model...', or 'Add Code Generation
//// Item...'.
